# Nikita_Final_Project

--Favorite Football Player App --Nature of the project:
This is a java based project, I have made it simple, very user friendly and easy to use.

In my project I can add a favorite football player, remove the favorite player
and search the player by text writing. It has checks that
you can't search an empty box, If the text box is empty than it will display an error
message. If you complete the text box than it will display the success message.
I wanted the interfaceto be simple so i could learn whilst creating the project and not 
struggle and have massive errors to sort out.
